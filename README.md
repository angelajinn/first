# Recipe Analyzer
An application that analyzes recipe and ingredient data by modulizing different components into multiple Python packages with the goal to become more familiar with the Python language. Database schemas are created to store recipe and ingredient data and inspect the relationship between data objects. SQL(PostGres) is used to analyze the data where foreign keys and other constraints are established to keep data integrity. 

Different functions were implemented to analyze the data. These functions include: 
1. Counting the number of recipes
2. Counting the number of ingredients in a recipe
3. Printing the recipes that consist of the inputted ingredients

Next Steps:
- Incoporate SQL program with recipes and ingredients into Python program
- Apply a large dataset of recipes into the program
